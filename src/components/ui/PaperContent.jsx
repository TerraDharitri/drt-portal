## **2. Introduction: Bridging Web3 and Sustainable Agriculture**

### (2.1) Why Blockchain for Farmers?

For too long, the backbone of our global food supply – the farmers themselves – have been underserved by traditional systems. Caught in a web of intermediaries, fluctuating prices, and limited access to fair markets, farmers often struggle to thrive, despite their essential role in feeding the world. Blockchain technology, with its core principles of decentralization, transparency, and tokenization, offers a powerful paradigm shift, presenting a unique opportunity to empower farmers and reshape the agricultural landscape for the better.

* **2.1.1 Decentralization for Fair Pricing and Market Access:** Traditional agricultural markets are often opaque and centralized, leaving farmers vulnerable to price manipulation and exploitation by intermediaries. Blockchain's decentralized nature offers a direct connection to global markets, eliminating unnecessary middlemen and empowering farmers to access fairer prices for their produce. Through decentralized marketplaces built on Dharitri, farmers can directly list and sell their crops, connecting with buyers across the globe and retaining a greater share of the value they create. This direct access fosters economic empowerment and reduces reliance on centralized systems that often disadvantage small-scale farmers.  
* **2.1.2 Transparency for Trust in Supply Chains and Traceability:** Modern agricultural supply chains are complex and often lack transparency, making it difficult for consumers to verify the origin, quality, and ethical sourcing of their food. Blockchain's immutable ledger provides an unprecedented level of transparency and traceability. By recording every step of the agricultural supply chain on Dharitri – from farm to table – we can build trust and accountability. Consumers can trace their food back to its source, verifying sustainable farming practices, ethical labor conditions, and the authenticity of products. This transparency empowers consumers to make informed choices and rewards farmers committed to sustainable and ethical agriculture.  
* **2.1.3 Tokenization for New Farmer Revenue Streams:** Beyond just facilitating trade, blockchain's tokenization capabilities unlock entirely new revenue streams for farmers, particularly in the growing field of environmental sustainability. Dharitri empowers farmers to participate in:  
  * **Carbon Credit Markets:** By verifying and tokenizing their carbon sequestration efforts (e.g., through reforestation, soil health practices), farmers can generate and sell carbon credits directly to businesses seeking to offset their emissions, creating a financial incentive for sustainable land management.  
  * **Data Monetization:** Farmers collect vast amounts of valuable data – soil health, weather patterns, crop yields, and more. Through Dharitri's data marketplaces, farmers can securely and transparently monetize this data, selling it to researchers, agri-tech companies, and policymakers, creating a new revenue stream from a previously untapped asset.  
  * **DeFi and Financial Inclusion:** By participating in the Dharitri ecosystem, farmers gain access to decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and services, including the COME stablecoin, enabling them to access loans, insurance, and other financial instruments with greater ease and lower costs, fostering financial inclusion and resilience.

Together, REWA and COME form the economic foundation of Dharitri, creating a powerful and virtuous cycle that empowers farmers, drives sustainable agriculture, and builds a thriving and impactful blockchain ecosystem for a greener future.

## **3. Technical Architecture: Scalable, Accessible, and Energy-Efficient**

Dharitri is built upon a cutting-edge technical architecture, carefully engineered to deliver exceptional scalability, robust security, and remarkable energy efficiency – the foundational pillars for a blockchain designed for mass adoption and real-world impact. Leveraging the proven foundation of a MultiversX fork, Dharitri incorporates several key architectural innovations to create a platform that is both powerful and accessible.

### (3.1) Adaptive State Sharding: Horizontal Scalability for Mass Adoption

To achieve the high throughput and low latency required for real-world applications, Dharitri implements **Adaptive State Sharding**, a sophisticated technique that allows the network to scale horizontally, dynamically adjusting its capacity to meet demand. Imagine Dharitri as a bustling marketplace:

* **3.1.1 Mechanism: Dynamic Shard Splitting and Merging** Dharitri intelligently divides its network into multiple independent "shards," like dividing a large marketplace into smaller, specialized districts. Each shard functions as a self-contained blockchain, processing its own set of transactions and maintaining its own portion of the network state. The "Adaptive" nature of our sharding means that the number of shards can dynamically adjust based on network traffic. During peak hours, when transaction volume is high, Dharitri automatically splits shards, creating more parallel processing lanes to handle the increased load. Conversely, during quieter periods, shards can be merged to optimize resource utilization. This dynamic adjustment ensures that the network always operates efficiently, scaling up or down as needed.  
* **3.1.2 Shard Pruning: Efficient Data Management** As a high-throughput blockchain, Dharitri will inevitably generate a significant volume of data over time. To manage this data growth efficiently and prevent blockchain bloat, Dharitri implements a **Shard Pruning** mechanism. Like archiving old records in a well-organized filing system, shard pruning periodically archives older, less frequently accessed data, freeing up valuable storage space on the active shards. This ensures that validators can operate efficiently without being burdened by constantly growing storage requirements, contributing to the long-term sustainability of the network.  
* **3.1.3 Impact: High Throughput, Low Latency, and Scalability** The combination of Adaptive State Sharding and Shard Pruning allows Dharitri to achieve remarkable scalability and performance:  
  * **High Throughput (15,000+ TPS):** Dharitri is designed to process over 15,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is architecturally capable of scaling to 100,000+ TPS and beyond through further shard expansion. This level of throughput positions Dharitri to handle the transaction volume of real-world applications, from high-frequency DeFi trading to enterprise-grade supply chain management.  
  * **Low Latency (1-2 Second Finality - Intra-Shard, 5 Seconds - Cross-Shard):** Dharitri achieves fast transaction finality, with intra-shard transactions confirming in just 1-2 seconds, and even cross-shard transactions finalizing within approximately 5 seconds. This rapid finality ensures a smooth and responsive user experience, crucial for applications requiring quick confirmations, such as point-of-sale systems or real-time data verification.  
  * **Linear Scalability:** Dharitri's sharding architecture allows for near-linear scalability. As the network grows and more validators join, the transaction processing capacity increases proportionally, ensuring that performance remains consistently high even with increasing adoption and network traffic.

* **3.1.4 Farmer-Friendly Note:** Imagine a large group of farmers working together to harvest a vast field. *Adaptive State Sharding is like dividing the field into smaller sections and assigning different teams to each section. Each team works in parallel, harvesting their section quickly and efficiently. If the field is very large (high transaction volume), you can simply add more teams (shards) to increase the overall harvesting speed. Shard pruning is like efficiently managing the harvested crops – storing the most recent harvest in easily accessible locations and archiving older harvests to free up space.* This allows the entire farm (Dharitri network) to operate much faster and more efficiently, ensuring everyone gets their work done quickly.

### (3.2) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Consensus: Energy Efficiency and Robust Security

Dharitri employs a **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** consensus mechanism, a next-generation approach to blockchain security that offers significant advantages in terms of energy efficiency, scalability, and security compared to older Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems.

* **3.2.1 Validator Tiers and Requirements: Primary and Secondary Validators** To ensure both robust security and broad participation, Dharitri implements a tiered validator system:  
  * **Primary Validators:** These are the core validators of the Dharitri network, responsible for the highest levels of performance and security. They are required to stake a minimum of **100,000 REWA**, maintain **95%+ uptime**, and operate **enterprise-grade hardware** to ensure optimal network performance and resilience.  
  * **Secondary Validators:** To encourage decentralization and broader participation, Dharitri also includes Secondary Validators with slightly lower requirements. Secondary Validators are required to stake a minimum of **25,000 REWA** and maintain **85%+ uptime**, providing a lower barrier to entry for individuals and smaller organizations to contribute to network security.

* **3.2.2 Validator Selection Process and Trust Score System** Dharitri's validator selection process is designed to be both meritocratic and randomized, ensuring fairness and preventing any single entity from gaining undue influence:  
  * **Stake-Weighted Selection:** Validators with a higher stake of REWA have a higher probability of being selected to participate in consensus, aligning network security with economic commitment.  
  * **Trust Score System:** Beyond stake, Dharitri incorporates a **Trust Score** system to evaluate validators based on their performance and contribution to the network. The Trust Score is a public rating (0-100) calculated based on:  
    * **Uptime (40% Weight):** Percentage of time the validator is online and operational, ensuring network availability.  
    * **Latency (30% Weight):** Speed of processing and confirming transactions, reflecting validator efficiency.  
    * **Governance Participation (30% Weight):** Active participation in governance proposals and voting, rewarding community engagement.  
  *   
  * **Tiered Validator Rewards (Trust Score Based):** Validators with higher Trust Scores are rewarded with **Tiered Bonuses** on their staking APR, incentivizing validators to maintain high performance and contribute positively to the network. Conversely, validators with low Trust Scores face **Penalties** (reduced rewards), ensuring accountability and discouraging underperformance.

* **3.2.3 Slashing Mechanism: Ensuring Accountability** To further ensure validator accountability and network integrity, Dharitri implements a robust **Slashing Mechanism**:  
  * **Downtime Penalties:** Validators who fail to meet the minimum uptime requirements (below 95% for Primary, below 85% for Secondary) face a **1% slashing penalty** of their staked REWA *per epoch* of low uptime.  
  * **Major Offense Penalties:** Validators who engage in malicious activities, such as **double-signing blocks** (attempting to create conflicting transactions) or other Byzantine behavior, face a **severe 10% slashing penalty** of their staked REWA, as well as **blacklisting** from the network, effectively removing them from future participation.  
  * **Slashing Pool - Rewards for Honest Validators:** To further incentivize honest validator behavior, **50% of all slashed REWA tokens are burned**, permanently reducing supply and increasing scarcity. The remaining **50% of slashed REWA are redistributed to honest, high-performing validators**, further rewarding good actors and enhancing network security.

* **3.2.4 Energy Efficiency Advantages: Eco-Friendly Consensus** Dharitri's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism is inherently **vastly more energy-efficient** than older Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems like Bitcoin. PoS eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining, reducing Dharitri's environmental footprint by an estimated **99% compared to Bitcoin**. This energy efficiency is a core principle of Dharitri, aligning with our commitment to environmental sustainability and ensuring that the network operates in an eco-friendly manner.  
* **3.2.5 Farmer-Friendly Note:** Imagine a group of farmers working together to secure the harvest. *Proof-of-Stake is like choosing the most reliable and experienced farmers (validators) to oversee the process, based on their reputation and commitment (stake). Farmers who do a good job (high Trust Score) get rewarded with a larger share of the harvest (higher APR), while farmers who are negligent or dishonest (low uptime, malicious behavior) face penalties (slashing). This ensures that only the most trustworthy and hardworking farmers are in charge of protecting the community's harvest (Dharitri network).*

### (3.3) Virtual Machine Environment: Developer-Friendly and Cost-Effective

Dharitri provides a versatile and developer-friendly **Virtual Machine (VM) environment** that supports a wide range of smart contract development languages, ensuring flexibility and ease of use for developers building decentralized applications (dApps) on the platform.

This cost-effectiveness is crucial for enabling mass adoption and making Dharitri a practical platform for everyday use cases, particularly in price-sensitive sectors like agriculture and emerging economies.

### (3.4) Cross-Chain Interoperability: Expanding Reach and Utility

In today's interconnected blockchain landscape, interoperability is essential. Dharitri is designed for seamless communication and asset transfer with other leading blockchain networks through robust **Cross-Chain Bridges**.

* **Native Bridges to Ethereum, BSC, Solana:** Dharitri will launch with native bridges to three of the most prominent blockchain ecosystems: **Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and Solana**. These bridges will allow for seamless and secure transfer of assets (tokens, data, and potentially NFTs in the future) between Dharitri and these major chains, expanding Dharitri's reach and utility.  
* **REWA as Bridge Gas: Fostering Interoperability and REWA Utility** To further enhance REWA utility and facilitate cross-chain transactions, **REWA will be used as the "gas" token for cross-chain swaps and transfers**. A small **0.1% fee in REWA** will be charged for cross-chain transactions, creating a demand sink for REWA and incentivizing users to hold and use REWA for interoperability purposes. This fee also contributes to the Dharitri ecosystem revenue and can be further directed towards deflationary mechanisms or ecosystem development.

## **4. Tokenomics Design: REWA - Fueling Farmer Empowerment and Sustainable Growth**

The REWA token is the lifeblood of the Dharitri ecosystem, carefully designed to be more than just a cryptocurrency; it is the fuel that powers a sustainable and thriving economy, empowering farmers, securing the network, and driving long-term value creation. Dharitri's tokenomics model is meticulously crafted to balance controlled inflation with robust deflationary mechanisms, incentivize key stakeholders, and ensure the long-term health and stability of the ecosystem.

### (4.1) REWA Token Utility: Powering the Dharitri Ecosystem

REWA is the native utility token of the Dharitri blockchain, designed with a diverse range of use cases that drive demand and create tangible value within the ecosystem:

* **Transaction Fees (Gas):** REWA serves as the primary gas token for the Dharitri network. Users require REWA to pay for all transactions, smart contract executions, data storage, and interactions within the Dharitri ecosystem. As network adoption grows and transaction volume increases, demand for REWA to pay for gas fees will naturally rise, driving utility and value accrual. *Farmer-Friendly Example: Farmers use REWA to pay for listing their crops on the Dharitri marketplace, securing loans, or verifying their sustainable farming practices on the blockchain.*  
* **Staking: Securing the Network and Earning Rewards:** REWA is the essential token for securing the Dharitri network through our Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Validators must stake a significant amount of REWA to participate in block production and transaction validation, ensuring network security and integrity. Delegators can also stake their REWA holdings to validators, contributing to network security and earning a share of the staking rewards. *Farmer-Friendly Example: Farmers or farmer cooperatives with REWA holdings can stake their tokens to become validators or delegators, earning passive income and directly contributing to the security of the Dharitri network that they rely on.*  
* **Governance: Community-Driven Decision Making:** REWA empowers holders to participate in the governance of the Dharitri ecosystem through our Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). REWA holders have voting rights to shape the future of the platform, proposing and voting on protocol upgrades, treasury allocations, strategic partnerships, and key network parameters, ensuring community-driven evolution and alignment with the needs of the ecosystem and its users, including farmers. *Farmer-Friendly Example: Farmers can use their REWA holdings to vote on proposals that directly impact the agricultural community, such as funding for farmer education programs, subsidies for sustainable farming tools, or the expansion of the Dharitri marketplace to new regions.*  
* **REWA-Powered Data Marketplaces: Facilitating Environmental Data Exchange:** REWA is the core currency within Dharitri's Data Marketplaces for Environmental Sustainability Data. Data users require REWA to purchase and access valuable environmental datasets listed on the marketplaces, fostering data transparency and informed decision-making for sustainability. Data providers, including farmers who contribute valuable data, can earn REWA by listing and selling their datasets. Validators and specialized data validators stake REWA to participate in data verification processes, ensuring data quality and earning rewards in REWA. *Farmer-Friendly Example: Farmers can earn REWA by selling verified data about their soil health, water usage, or carbon sequestration efforts on the Dharitri Data Marketplace, creating a new revenue stream from their valuable data assets.*  
* **Subnet Access and Fees: Enterprise-Driven Demand:** Dharitri Subnets, custom blockchains tailored for specific applications, create significant demand for REWA. Enterprises and organizations launching subnets on Dharitri are required to pay fees in REWA to the network, creating a recurring revenue stream. Validators participating in subnets must also stake REWA, further driving demand and utility. *Farmer-Friendly Example: Agricultural enterprises using Dharitri subnets to track their supply chains or manage carbon credits will drive demand for REWA by paying subnet fees and requiring validators to stake REWA, indirectly benefiting the entire REWA ecosystem, including farmers.*  
* **COME Stablecoin Ecosystem: Enhancing Financial Utility:** While COME is a separate stablecoin designed for price stability, it is deeply integrated into the Dharitri ecosystem and enhances the utility of REWA. Fees generated from COME transactions contribute to the Dharitri treasury, and the COME ecosystem is designed to drive activity and adoption within the Dharitri network, indirectly benefiting REWA through increased network usage and economic activity. *Farmer-Friendly Example: Farmers can use the COME stablecoin for everyday transactions within the Dharitri ecosystem, knowing its price is stable and predictable, while the fees generated from COME transactions contribute to the overall health and sustainability of the Dharitri network and REWA token.*

### (4.2) Token Allocation & Rationale: A Balanced Distribution for Sustainable Growth

The total supply of REWA is fixed and capped at **10,000,000,000 REWA**, with a carefully designed allocation strategy to ensure a balanced distribution that prioritizes long-term growth, network security, and community alignment. The token allocation is structured as follows:

| Category | % of Supply | Tokens | Release Schedule | Purpose & Rationale |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | ----- |
| Private Sale | 10% | 1,000,000,000 | 12-month cliff → 48-month linear | To reward early backers who provided crucial initial funding for the project's development and launch. The 12-month cliff and 48-month linear vesting schedule are designed to prevent post-TGE dumping and ensure long-term alignment of early investors with the project's success. |
| Team & Advisors | 10% | 1,000,000,000 | 24-month cliff → 72-month linear | To incentivize the core team and advisors for their long-term commitment to the project. The 24-month cliff ensures that team tokens are locked until well after the mainnet launch, demonstrating commitment to delivering key milestones. The subsequent 72-month linear vesting schedule further prevents early dumping and aligns team incentives with the long-term success of Dharitri. |
| Public Sale (IEO) | 8% | 800,000,000 | 100% at TGE | To facilitate a fair and broad launch of REWA to the public and provide initial liquidity for exchange listings. The relatively smaller allocation for the IEO (8% of total supply) is designed to avoid excessive dilution and manage initial circulating supply while still providing sufficient tokens for public participation and exchange liquidity bootstrapping. |
| Staking Rewards | 25% | 2,500,000,000 | 10-year linear release | To incentivize validators and delegators to participate in securing the Dharitri network through staking. A significant portion of the total supply (25%) is allocated to staking rewards to ensure robust network security and encourage long-term validator participation. The 10-year linear release ensures a sustainable and predictable emission of staking rewards over an extended period, balancing inflation with network security incentives. |
| Ecosystem Development | 18% | 1,800,000,000 | 10-year milestone-based (performance-linked) | To fund the growth and expansion of the Dharitri ecosystem, supporting the development of dApps, integrations, and key infrastructure components. The 10-year milestone-based release schedule ensures that ecosystem grants are strategically allocated and tied to tangible adoption metrics and performance milestones, maximizing the ROI of ecosystem funding. |
| Community Incentives | 10% | 1,000,000,000 | 6-year activity-based (meritocratic) | To reward and incentivize active community participation, fostering a strong and engaged Dharitri community. The 6-year activity-based release ensures that community rewards are distributed fairly and meritocratically to users who actively contribute to the ecosystem, such as governance voters, content creators, and bug reporters, fostering genuine engagement and long-term community loyalty. |
| Treasury Reserve | 8% | 800,000,000 | 10-year DAO-controlled | To provide a strategic reserve of funds for the Dharitri DAO to manage and allocate for future protocol upgrades, security audits, strategic partnerships, and unforeseen needs. The 10-year DAO-controlled release ensures that treasury funds are managed transparently and allocated through community governance, preventing misuse and ensuring alignment with the long-term interests of the Dharitri ecosystem. |
| COME Development | 2% | 200,000,000 | 5-year milestone-based | To accelerate the development and launch of the COME stablecoin, a key component of the Dharitri ecosystem designed to enhance financial inclusivity and price stability for farmer transactions. The 5-year milestone-based release ensures that COME development is prioritized and adequately funded, accelerating its deployment and integration within the Dharitri ecosystem. |
| Liquidity Mining | 5% | 500,000,000 | 24-month linear + gradual penalties | To bootstrap liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and ensure a liquid and accessible market for REWA tokens. The 24-month linear release, combined with gradual penalties for early withdrawals, is designed to incentivize long-term liquidity provision and discourage short-term "farm-and-dump" behavior, promoting stable and reliable DEX liquidity. |
| Marketing & Growth | 4% | 400,000,000 | 4-year KPI-based | To fund marketing initiatives and growth strategies designed to drive global awareness and user adoption of the Dharitri platform. The 4-year KPI-based release ensures that marketing funds are strategically allocated and tied to measurable user growth and adoption metrics, maximizing the ROI of marketing spend and ensuring that marketing efforts are directly contributing to the expansion of the Dharitri ecosystem. |
| Total | 100% | 10,000,000,000 |  |  |

### (4.3) Annual Token Release Schedule (2025-2035): Transparency and Controlled Inflation

To ensure transparency and provide a clear understanding of the REWA token supply dynamics, Dharitri publishes a detailed annual token release schedule for the first 10 years after mainnet launch (2025-2035):

| 2028 | 250 | 139 | 250 | 180 | 167 | 60 | 40 | 0 | 100 | 1,226M | 5,639M |
| 2029 | 250 | 139 | 250 | 180 | 167 | 60 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1,046M | 6,685M |
| 2030 | 0 | 139 | 250 | 180 | 167 | 80 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 796M | 7,481M |
| 2031 | 0 | 139 | 250 | 180 | 167 | 80 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 796M | 8,277M |
| 2032 | 0 | 139 | 250 | 180 | 0 | 60 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 629M | 8,906M |
| 2033 | 0 | 139 | 250 | 180 | 0 | 60 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 629M | 9,535M |
| 2034 | 0 | 0 | 250 | 180 | 0 | 80 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 510M | 10,045M |
| 2035 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 10,045M |

**Notes:**

* **Controlled Inflation:** The annual token release schedule is carefully controlled, with annual unlocks gradually decreasing over time and remaining consistently below 15-20% of the total supply in any given year. This gradual release helps to manage inflation and prevent sudden supply shocks, promoting market stability and long-term token value.  
* **Peak Circulating Supply:** The circulating supply is projected to peak at **10,085,000,000 REWA** in 2034 before deflationary burn mechanisms begin to reduce the overall supply (see Section 4.4).  
* **Vesting Schedules:** The release schedule incorporates vesting periods for key stakeholder groups (Private Sale, Team & Advisors, Liquidity Mining) to ensure long-term commitment and prevent early dumping of tokens, further contributing to market stability and investor confidence.  
* **Milestone-Based Releases:** Ecosystem Development and COME Development allocations are tied to milestone-based releases, ensuring that funds are strategically deployed and linked to tangible project progress and adoption metrics, maximizing the ROI of ecosystem funding and incentivizing performance-driven development.

### (4.4) Deflationary Burn Mechanics: Driving Scarcity and Value Appreciation

To counteract inflationary pressures from token emissions and create long-term scarcity for REWA, Dharitri implements a robust **deflationary burn mechanism** that permanently removes REWA tokens from circulation, driving value appreciation and benefiting long-term holders. The burn mechanism consists of three key components:

* **4.4.1 Transaction Fee Burns: Base Burn Rate** A fixed percentage of **25% of**  collected on the Dharitri network are **burned** – permanently removed from the total supply. As network adoption and transaction volume grow, this base burn mechanism will become a significant and consistent source of deflation, reducing the overall REWA supply over time.  
  * *Example:* If the Dharitri network processes 1 Billion transactions per year, with an average transaction fee of 0.0001 REWA, this would generate 100,000 REWA in total transaction fees annually. With a 25% base burn rate, **25,000,000 REWA would be burned annually from transaction fees alone** in this scenario, reducing the circulating supply and creating deflationary pressure.

* **4.4.2 Dynamic Burn Adjustments: Congestion-Driven Burns** To further enhance deflationary pressure during periods of high network activity and increased demand, Dharitri implements **Dynamic Burn Adjustments**. When the network Transaction Per Second (TPS) exceeds **5,000 TPS**, indicating network congestion and increased demand for REWA, the transaction fee burn rate **increases to 35%** (a +10% increase). This dynamic burn mechanism ensures that deflationary pressure automatically scales with network usage, further enhancing scarcity and value appreciation during periods of high demand.  
  * *Example:* During periods of network congestion exceeding 5,000 TPS, a 0.001 REWA transaction fee would result in **0.00035 REWA burned (35% dynamic burn rate)**, compared to 0.00025 REWA burned during normal network conditions (25% base burn rate).

* **4.4.3 Slashing Burns: Validator Accountability and Deflationary Impact** To further contribute to deflation and ensure validator accountability, **50% of all REWA tokens slashed** from validators due to downtime, malicious behavior, or protocol violations are **permanently burned**. This mechanism not only reinforces network security by penalizing bad actors but also adds another consistent source of deflation to the REWA token supply.  
  * *Example:* If validators are slashed a total of 100,000 REWA in a given year due to various penalties, **50,000 REWA will be burned**, reducing the circulating supply, while the remaining 50,000 REWA are redistributed to honest, high-performing validators, further incentivizing good validator behavior.

* **3.3.5 Annual Burn Projections: Quantifying Deflationary Impact** Based on conservative estimates of network growth and transaction volume, Dharitri projects a significant and increasing annual burn rate over the first 10 years after launch:

| Year | Transaction Burns | Slashing Burns | Total Annual Burns | Cumulative Burns | Remaining Supply |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2025 | 50M | 5M | 55M | 55M | 9,945M |
| 2026 | 80M | 10M | 90M | 145M | 9,855M |
| 2027 | 120M | 15M | 135M | 280M | 9,720M |
| 2028 | 150M | 20M | 170M | 450M | 9,550M |
| 2029 | 180M | 25M | 205M | 655M | 9,345M |
| 2030 | 200M | 30M | 230M | 885M | 9,115M |
| 2031 | 220M | 35M | 255M | 1,140M | 8,860M |
| 2032 | 240M | 40M | 280M | 1,420M | 8,580M |
| 2033 | 260M | 45M | 305M | 1,725M | 8,275M |
| 2034 | 280M | 50M | 330M | 2,055M | 7,945M |
| 2035 | 300M | 55M | 355M | 2,410M | 7,590M |

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Significant Deflationary Impact:** Dharitri's burn mechanisms are projected to remove **2.41 Billion REWA tokens from circulation by 2035**, representing a substantial **24.1% reduction** of the initial total supply.  
* **Long-Term Scarcity:** The burn mechanisms are designed to create increasing scarcity for REWA over time, potentially driving long-term value appreciation as demand for REWA within the ecosystem grows.  
* **Controlled Supply Reduction:** While burns create deflation, the remaining supply of **7.59 Billion REWA by 2035** ensures that there is still ample token supply to fuel a large and thriving Dharitri ecosystem and support mass adoption. The token supply is not designed to become *excessively* deflationary, which could hinder network utility and economic activity.

### (4.5) Staking Rewards & Dynamic APR: Incentivizing Validator Participation and Network Security

To ensure robust network security and incentivize validator participation, Dharitri implements a generous and dynamically adjusted staking rewards system:

| Year | Annual Staking Emissions | Staked Supply | Base APR | Loyalty APR (+1% for 5+ years) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2025 | 300M | 500M | 60% | 61% |
| 2026 | 250M | 1.5B | 16.6% | 17.6% |
| 2027 | 200M | 2.5B | 8% | 9% |
| 2030 | 150M | 3.5B | 4.3% | 5.3% |
| 2035 | 100M | 4.0B | 2.5% | 3.5% |

* **Competitive Base APR:** Dharitri offers a competitive **Base Annual Percentage Rate (APR)** for staking REWA, starting at a high **60% APR in Year 1** to incentivize early validator participation and bootstrap network security. The Base APR gradually decreases over time as the staked supply grows and the network matures, ensuring long-term sustainability of staking emissions.  
* **Loyalty APR Bonus:** To reward long-term commitment and loyalty to the Dharitri network, delegators who maintain their stake delegation for **5+ years** receive an **additional +1% Loyalty APR Bonus**, further incentivizing long-term stake commitment and network stability.  
* **Tiered Validator Rewards (Trust Score Based):** As described in Section 3.2, validators with higher **Trust Scores** (reflecting uptime, latency, and governance participation) earn **Tiered Bonuses** on their staking APR (up to +15%), rewarding high-performing and reliable validators and further enhancing network security and performance.  
* **Dynamic APR Adjustments: Scaling with Network Usage** To ensure that staking rewards remain attractive and competitive even during periods of lower network usage or lower staking participation, Dharitri implements **Dynamic APR Adjustments**. The staking APR can **dynamically increase by up to +5%** during periods of **low staking participation** (e.g., if the overall staked supply falls below a certain threshold). This dynamic mechanism ensures that validator incentives remain robust and adaptable to changing network conditions, maintaining a healthy and secure validator ecosystem.

### (7.3) Quadratic Voting Mechanism: Balancing Influence and Ensuring Fair Representation

To ensure fair and balanced governance and prevent undue influence from large token holders, Dharitri implements **Quadratic Voting**, a more advanced and equitable voting mechanism compared to simple 1-token-1-vote systems:

* **1 REWA = √votes: Mitigating Whale Influence:** In Quadratic Voting, the voting power of each REWA token **diminishes with the number of tokens held**. Instead of a linear 1-token-1-vote system, Quadratic Voting utilizes a square root function, where **1 REWA = √votes**. This means that while holding more REWA still grants more voting power, the *increase* in voting power diminishes as the token holding size increases.  
  * *Example:* A user holding 10,000 REWA would have 100 votes (√10,000 = 100), while a user holding 1,000,000 REWA would have 1,000 votes (√1,000,000 = 1,000). While the larger holder still has significantly more voting power, it is not proportionally as large as in a linear voting system (where 1,000,000 REWA would equal 100 times the voting power of 10,000 REWA).  
  * *Impact:* Quadratic Voting effectively **reduces the disproportionate influence of "whales"** (very large token holders) in governance decisions, preventing a small number of wealthy individuals from dominating the DAO and ensuring a more balanced and representative governance process.

* **Delegated Voting: Empowering Expertise and Farmer Representation** To further enhance governance participation and ensure that diverse perspectives are represented, Dharitri implements **Delegated Voting**. REWA holders who may not have the time or expertise to actively participate in every governance decision can **delegate their voting power to trusted individuals or entities** within the Dharitri ecosystem.  
  * *Farmer Representation through Delegated Voting:* Farmers, who may have valuable on-the-ground knowledge of agricultural practices and community needs but less technical expertise in blockchain governance, can delegate their votes to trusted farmer cooperatives, agricultural NGOs, or farmer representatives who can effectively represent their interests within the DAO.  
  * *Expert Delegation for Specialized Proposals:* REWA holders can also delegate their votes to domain experts in areas such as protocol development, tokenomics, environmental science, or legal compliance, ensuring that governance decisions are informed by specialized knowledge and expertise.  
  * *Transparency and Revocability of Delegations:* Delegated voting will be fully transparent and revocable, allowing REWA holders to easily track how their votes are being used and to change their delegation choices at any time, maintaining individual control and accountability.

* **Minimum Proposal Stake (10,000 REWA): Ensuring Proposal Quality** To prevent spam proposals and ensure that governance discussions are focused on serious and well-considered initiatives, Dharitri implements a **Minimum Proposal Stake** requirement. Users who wish to submit a governance proposal to the DAO will be required to stake a minimum of **10,000 REWA**. This stake requirement:  
  * **Deters Spam and Low-Quality Proposals:** Discourages frivolous or poorly thought-out proposals, ensuring that governance resources are focused on serious and impactful initiatives.  
  * **Demonstrates Proposer Commitment:** Indicates that proposers have a genuine stake in the Dharitri ecosystem and are committed to contributing to its long-term success.  
  * **Stake Refund for Successful Proposals:** To further incentivize valuable proposals, the minimum proposal stake can be designed to be **refundable** to proposers whose proposals are successfully passed by the DAO, rewarding positive contributions to governance.

### (7.4) Farmer DAO Committees: Regional Councils for Localized Farmer Needs

To ensure that the Dharitri DAO is truly responsive to the diverse needs and challenges of farmers across different regions and agricultural contexts, Dharitri will establish **Farmer DAO Committees**, regional councils within the DAO specifically focused on localized farmer needs and initiatives.

* **Regional Representation and Localized Decision-Making:** Farmer DAO Committees will be established to represent farmers in specific geographic regions or agricultural sectors (e.g., regional councils for specific countries or agricultural zones, specialized committees for specific crop types or farming practices). These committees will provide a platform for:  
  * **Farmer-Specific Proposal Submission and Discussion:** Farmer DAO Committees will provide dedicated channels for farmers to submit and discuss governance proposals specifically relevant to their localized needs and challenges, ensuring that farmer voices are heard and prioritized within the DAO.  
  * **Localized Resource Allocation and Prioritization:** Farmer DAO Committees will have a degree of autonomy in allocating a portion of ecosystem resources and community incentives to initiatives that directly benefit farmers within their specific regions or sectors, such as funding for localized farmer training programs, subsidies for regionally relevant sustainable farming tools, or the development of region-specific dApps tailored to local agricultural practices.  
  * **Farmer-Driven Governance for Localized Issues:** Farmer DAO Committees will empower farmers to make localized governance decisions related to issues that directly affect their communities, such as prioritizing regional infrastructure development, adapting verification protocols to local agricultural practices, or tailoring community support programs to meet specific regional needs.

* **Bridging Global Governance with Localized Needs:** Farmer DAO Committees will act as a crucial bridge between the global governance of the Dharitri DAO and the localized needs of diverse farming communities around the world, ensuring that governance decisions are both globally strategic and locally relevant, fostering a truly farmer-centric and inclusive governance ecosystem.

### (7.5) Transparency Dashboard: Real-time Monitoring and Farmer Accountability

Dharitri’s Validator Economics and Slashing mechanisms are meticulously designed to attract and retain a network of reliable, performant, and honest validators, ensuring the long-term security, stability, and efficiency of the Dharitri platform. Our validator model is structured to provide:

### (8.1) Validator Tiers and Requirements: Primary and Secondary Validators

To foster both robust security and broad participation, Dharitri implements a tiered validator system, offering different levels of participation and requirements:

* **Primary Validators: Enterprise-Grade Security and Performance** Primary Validators represent the core security backbone of the Dharitri network, responsible for the highest levels of performance, reliability, and security. To become a Primary Validator, participants must meet stringent requirements, demonstrating a significant commitment to the network:  
  * **Minimum Stake Requirement: 100,000 REWA:** Primary Validators are required to stake a substantial amount of **100,000 REWA**, demonstrating a significant economic commitment to the long-term success and security of the Dharitri network. This high stake requirement ensures that Primary Validators have "skin in the game" and are strongly incentivized to act honestly and maintain high performance.  
  * **Uptime Commitment: 95%+ Uptime Guarantee:** Primary Validators must guarantee a minimum uptime of **95%**, ensuring consistent network availability and responsiveness. This high uptime requirement necessitates robust infrastructure, reliable hardware, and professional operational practices.  
  * **Enterprise-Grade Hardware and Infrastructure:** Primary Validators are expected to operate **enterprise-grade hardware and infrastructure**, meeting specific technical specifications for processing power, memory, storage, and network bandwidth, ensuring optimal network performance and scalability.  
  * **Active Governance Participation:** Primary Validators are expected to actively participate in DAO governance, contributing to proposal discussions, voting on key network parameters, and shaping the future direction of the Dharitri ecosystem, demonstrating a commitment to community-driven governance and network evolution.  
* In return for meeting these stringent requirements, Primary Validators are rewarded with the highest base APR for staking, bonus rewards based on their Trust Score (as detailed in Section 8.3), and preferential access to enterprise subnet validation opportunities, making Primary Validator status a highly desirable and economically rewarding role within the Dharitri ecosystem.  
* **Secondary Validators: Broadening Participation and Decentralization** To encourage broader participation and decentralization of the validator network, Dharitri also includes Secondary Validators with more accessible requirements:  
  * **Minimum Stake Requirement: 25,000 REWA:** Secondary Validators are required to stake a lower minimum amount of **25,000 REWA** (compared to 100,000 REWA for Primary Validators), lowering the barrier to entry and allowing a wider range of participants to contribute to network security.  
  * **Uptime Commitment: 85%+ Uptime Guarantee:** Secondary Validators must guarantee a minimum uptime of **85%** (slightly lower than Primary Validators' 95% requirement), still ensuring a reasonable level of network availability and reliability.  
  * **Standard Hardware and Infrastructure:** Secondary Validators are expected to operate **standard hardware and infrastructure**, meeting more accessible technical specifications compared to Primary Validators, further lowering the barrier to entry.  
  * **Governance Participation Encouraged:** While not mandatory, Secondary Validators are encouraged to participate in DAO governance, contributing to community-driven decision-making and ecosystem evolution.  
* Secondary Validators receive a slightly lower Base APR for staking compared to Primary Validators, but still benefit from the core staking rewards, tiered rewards based on Trust Score, and the opportunity to contribute to network security and earn REWA, making Secondary Validator status a valuable and accessible entry point into the Dharitri validator ecosystem. The tiered validator system ensures a balance between robust security provided by highly performant Primary Validators and broader decentralization and accessibility through Secondary Validators, creating a resilient and inclusive validator network.

### (8.2) Staking Rewards and APR: Incentivizing Participation and Long-Term Commitment

Dharitri's Staking Rewards mechanism is designed to be generous, dynamic, and sustainable, incentivizing validator participation, securing the network, and rewarding long-term commitment:

* **Competitive Base APR:** Dharitri offers a highly competitive **Base Annual Percentage Rate (APR)** for staking REWA, starting at a compelling **60% APR in Year 1** to attract early validators and bootstrap network security. This high initial APR provides a strong incentive for early adoption and validator participation, ensuring robust network security from the outset. The Base APR is then gradually reduced over time (as detailed in the table below) as the staked supply grows and the network matures, ensuring long-term sustainability of staking emissions and balancing inflation with attractive validator rewards.  
* **Loyalty APR Bonus: Rewarding Long-Term Delegators:** To incentivize long-term commitment and loyalty to the Dharitri network, delegators who maintain their stake delegation for **5+ consecutive years** receive an **additional +1% Loyalty APR Bonus** on top of the Base APR. This loyalty bonus rewards long-term holders, encourages stake commitment, and further contributes to network stability and security by incentivizing users to remain active participants in the Dharitri ecosystem for extended periods.  
* **Tiered Validator Rewards (Trust Score Based): Performance-Based Incentives and Penalties** Dharitri implements a **Tiered Validator Rewards** system, based on the **Trust Score** (as detailed in Section 3.2), to incentivize high-performing and reliable validator operations:  
  * **Top 10% Validators (Highest Trust Score): +15% APR Bonus:** Validators who consistently achieve the highest Trust Scores, demonstrating exceptional uptime, low latency, and active governance participation, receive a significant **+15% Bonus APR** on top of the Base APR and Loyalty Bonus (if applicable). This substantial bonus rewards top-performing validators, incentivizes excellence in validator operations, and further enhances network performance and reliability by rewarding the most valuable contributors to network security.  
  * **Middle 80% of Validators: Base APR:** The majority of validators, representing the core of the validator network, receive the **Base APR** for staking REWA, providing a competitive and sustainable baseline reward for validator participation.  
  * **Bottom 10% of Validators (Lowest Trust Score): -10% APR Penalty:** Validators who consistently score in the bottom 10% of Trust Scores, indicating underperformance or lack of engagement, face a **-10% APR Penalty**, receiving a reduced APR compared to the Base APR. This penalty mechanism discourages underperforming validators, incentivizes improvement, and ensures that validators are held accountable for maintaining high standards of network operation and security.

* **Dynamic APR Adjustments: Scaling with Network Usage** To ensure that staking rewards remain attractive and competitive even as network conditions evolve, Dharitri implements **Dynamic APR Adjustments**. The **Base APR can dynamically increase by up to +5%** during periods of **low staking participation** (e.g., if the overall staked supply ratio falls below a certain threshold, indicating a need for greater validator incentives). This dynamic mechanism ensures that staking rewards remain competitive and attractive even during periods of lower network activity or market fluctuations, maintaining a healthy and robust validator ecosystem and preventing a decline in network security due to reduced validator participation.

**Staking Rewards & APR Schedule (Illustrative):**

| Year | Annual Staking Emissions | Staked Supply | Base APR | Loyalty APR (+1% for 5+ years) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2025 | 300M | 500M | 60% | 61% |
| 2026 | 250M | 1.5B | 16.6% | 17.6% |
| 2027 | 200M | 2.5B | 8% | 9% |
| 2030 | 150M | 3.5B | 4.3% | 5.3% |
| 2035 | 100M | 4.0B | 2.5% | 3.5% |

### (8.3) Tiered Validator Rewards (Trust Score): Performance-Based Incentives and Penalties

Dharitri's **Tiered Validator Rewards** system, based on the **Trust Score**, is a key innovation designed to create a performance-driven validator ecosystem, incentivizing validators to strive for excellence in uptime, latency, governance participation, and overall network contribution. The Trust Score system ensures that rewards are not solely based on stake, but also on demonstrable performance and valuable contributions to the Dharitri network, fostering a more meritocratic and robust validator ecosystem.

* **Trust Score Calculation: Multi-Factor Performance Evaluation** The **REWA Trust Score** for each validator is calculated based on a weighted average of multiple performance factors, ensuring a holistic and comprehensive evaluation of validator contributions:  
  * **Uptime (40% Weight):** Reflects the reliability and availability of the validator node, measured as the percentage of time the validator is online and actively participating in network operations. Higher uptime directly translates to a higher Trust Score, rewarding validators who maintain consistent network availability.  
  * **Latency (30% Weight):** Measures the speed and efficiency of the validator in processing transactions and confirming blocks, reflecting the validator's contribution to network performance and responsiveness. Lower latency (faster processing times) translates to a higher Trust Score, rewarding validators who optimize their infrastructure for speed and efficiency.  
  * **Governance Participation (30% Weight):** Reflects the validator's active engagement in DAO governance, measured by their participation in governance proposals, voting activity, and contributions to community discussions. Higher governance participation translates to a higher Trust Score, rewarding validators who actively contribute to shaping the future of the Dharitri ecosystem and community-driven decision-making.

* **Reward Bonus and Penalty Tiers: Incentivizing Excellence and Discouraging Underperformance** Based on their calculated Trust Score, validators are categorized into three tiers, each with a corresponding adjustment to their staking APR:  
  * **Top 10% of Validators (Highest Trust Score): +15% APR Bonus:** The top 10% of validators, consistently achieving the highest Trust Scores, are recognized as "Top Performers" and receive a significant **+15% Bonus APR** on top of their Base APR and Loyalty Bonus (if applicable). This substantial bonus serves as a powerful incentive for validators to strive for excellence and maintain top-tier performance, creating a competitive and high-performing validator ecosystem.  
  * **Middle 80% of Validators: Base APR:** The majority of validators, representing the core of the validator network and achieving average to good Trust Scores, receive the **Base APR** for staking REWA. This provides a competitive and sustainable baseline reward for reliable and consistent validator participation.  
  * **Bottom 10% of Validators (Lowest Trust Score): -10% APR Penalty:** The bottom 10% of validators, consistently scoring the lowest Trust Scores and indicating underperformance or lack of engagement, face a **-10% APR Penalty**, receiving a reduced APR compared to the Base APR. This penalty mechanism discourages underperforming validators, incentivizes improvement, and ensures accountability within the validator network, maintaining overall network quality and reliability.

* **Publicly Visible Trust Scores: Transparency and Validator Accountability** To ensure transparency and accountability, **Validator Trust Scores will be publicly visible** on the Dharitri Transparency Dashboard (as detailed in Section 7.5). This public visibility allows delegators to make informed decisions when choosing validators to delegate their stake to, incentivizing delegators to support high-performing and reliable validators and further reinforcing the performance-driven nature of the validator ecosystem. Public Trust Scores also provide validators with clear and transparent metrics for evaluating their performance and identifying areas for improvement, fostering a culture of continuous optimization and network enhancement.

### (8.4) Slashing Mechanism: Ensuring Accountability and Network Integrity

Dharitri's **Slashing Mechanism** is a critical security feature designed to deter malicious behavior, penalize underperforming validators, and maintain the overall integrity and reliability of the network. Slashing involves the forfeiture of a portion of a validator's staked REWA tokens as a penalty for violating protocol rules or failing to meet performance standards. The Slashing Mechanism is carefully designed to be:

* **Proportionate and Fair:** Slashing penalties are designed to be proportionate to the severity of the violation, with minor offenses incurring smaller penalties and major offenses resulting in more significant stake forfeiture. The tiered slashing structure ensures fairness and prevents disproportionate penalties for unintentional errors or minor performance fluctuations.  
* **Transparent and Verifiable:** Slashing conditions and penalties are clearly defined in the protocol and publicly documented, ensuring transparency and predictability. Slashing events will be publicly recorded and auditable on the Dharitri blockchain, allowing for community verification and accountability.  
* **Focused on Deterrence and Network Protection:** The primary goal of slashing is not punitive but rather **deterrent and protective**. Slashing is designed to discourage malicious behavior, incentivize validators to maintain high performance and adhere to protocol rules, and ultimately protect the security and integrity of the Dharitri network for all users.

**Slashing Conditions and Stake Forfeiture Amounts:**

* **Minor Offenses (e.g., Downtime Below Uptime Requirements): 1-3% Stake Slashed** Validators who fail to meet the minimum uptime requirements for their respective tiers (below 95% for Primary, below 85% for Secondary Validators) will face a **minor 1-3% slashing penalty** of their staked REWA *per epoch* of low uptime. The specific slashing percentage within this range may be dynamically adjusted by governance based on network conditions and overall validator performance. This penalty incentivizes validators to invest in robust infrastructure and maintain consistent network availability.  
* **Major Offenses (e.g., Double-Signing, Byzantine Behavior, Malicious Attacks): 10% Stake Slashed + Blacklisting** Validators who engage in major offenses that directly threaten network security and integrity, such as **double-signing blocks**, attempting to create conflicting transactions, participating in **Byzantine behavior** (maliciously disrupting consensus), or engaging in **network attacks**, will face a **severe 10% slashing penalty** of their staked REWA. In addition to stake forfeiture, validators found guilty of major offenses will also be **blacklisted** from the Dharitri network, permanently preventing them from participating as validators in the future, ensuring long-term network protection from malicious actors.  
* **Slashing Pool - Rewards for Honest Validators and Deflationary Impact:** To further enhance the positive impact of the Slashing Mechanism, the **slashed REWA tokens are strategically allocated**:  
  * **50% of Slashed REWA Burned (Deflationary Impact):** **Half of all slashed REWA tokens are permanently burned**, reducing the circulating supply and contributing to the overall deflationary pressure on the REWA token, benefiting all REWA holders and increasing scarcity over time.  
  * **50% of Slashed REWA Redistributed to Honest Validators (Rewards for Good Actors):** The remaining **50% of slashed REWA tokens are redistributed to honest, high-performing validators** (specifically, those in the Top 10% Trust Score tier), further rewarding validators who consistently maintain excellent performance and contribute positively to network security and reliability. This redistribution mechanism creates a positive feedback loop, incentivizing validators to strive for excellence and rewarding those who contribute most to the health and security of the Dharitri network.

### (8.5) Insurance Partnerships for Validators: Mitigating Slashing Risks and Enhancing Validator Confidence

To further mitigate potential risks associated with slashing penalties and enhance validator confidence and participation, Dharitri will explore strategic **Insurance Partnerships** with decentralized insurance providers (e.g., Nexus Mutual or similar platforms). These partnerships could provide validators with the option to purchase **decentralized insurance coverage** against slashing risks.

* **Optional Insurance for Validators:** Validators would have the *option* to purchase insurance coverage for their staked REWA, protecting a portion of their stake against potential slashing penalties due to unforeseen technical issues, downtime, or unintentional errors. Purchasing insurance would be *optional* and at the validator's discretion, allowing validators to manage their own risk tolerance and operational strategies.  
* **Decentralized Insurance Providers (e.g., Nexus Mutual):** Dharitri will explore partnerships with established decentralized insurance providers like Nexus Mutual or similar platforms that specialize in providing smart contract and protocol risk coverage. Decentralized insurance offers transparency, community-driven risk assessment, and trustless claim payouts, aligning with the decentralized ethos of Dharitri.  
* **Potential Benefits of Insurance Partnerships:** Insurance partnerships could offer several benefits to the Dharitri validator ecosystem:  
  * **Mitigating Validator Slashing Risks:** Provides validators with a safety net against potential slashing penalties, reducing the financial risks associated with validator participation and making validator roles more attractive, especially to risk-averse institutions or individuals.  
  * **Enhanced Validator Confidence and Participation:** Reduces validator anxiety about potential slashing penalties, encouraging broader validator participation and increasing the overall robustness and decentralization of the validator network.  
  * **Attracting Institutional Validators:** Insurance options could make validator roles more appealing to institutional investors and larger organizations who may have stricter risk management requirements and seek to mitigate potential slashing risks through insurance coverage.
